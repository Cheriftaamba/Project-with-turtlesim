# Project-with-turtlesim
ROS2 Python node to control turtlesim and draw geometric figures (square, rectangle, triangle, diamond) in sequence.  This project demonstrates fundamental ROS2 concepts (nodes, topics, publishers, timers) through a custom controller node that moves the turtle in turtlesim to draw various geometric shapes with precise turns and translations.
